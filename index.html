            <p>Dear Megan,</p>
            <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRINCESS U 20 (thatâ€™s a lil old hehe). JOKES JOKES, happy 20th birthday miss megan khanal, yk this is my 2nd time celebrating your birthday with u already wow, time really flies.</p>
            <p>I just wanna say thank you for having me apart of your birthday but also apart of ur life, you have a hectic life for sure and iâ€™m so glad i am apart of it. In honour of your 20th Birthday, i think itâ€™s fair I list 20 things I love about you.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How goddamn cute you are. Like that and your sexiness is unparalleled. From the moment I saw your profile I was like goddamn. That picture of u in that black dress in your post was THE photo that made me go fucking crazy for you, and that craziness as only gotten even stronger.</li>
              <li>Ur amazing curls, I cannot lie ur hair is so fucking good idk how else to say it. I know why ur friends said it was ur identity.</li>
              <li>How studious and hard working you are. Even if you donâ€™t believe it sometimes you are so smart, way smarter than me. You are aiming for big big things babe, and you can easily grab them.</li>
              <li>How you listen to the small things about me, like some of my hobbies. Like on my birthday you picked a place we could go plane watching which was really sweet, and not many people would know to do that for me.</li>
              <li>Your fashion sense. U know what works on me, i learnt that whole colour theory from u, and I try to apply it on my clothes. Also I know you want new clothes, ur fashion sense is so good ur gonna find the right clothes when you see them.</li>
              <li>Your piercing eyes, especially when they stare at me when u look up is so sexy, but also extremely cute, Im just like woah.</li>
              <li>Your smile, its really infectious, and soon its gonna look even better as this time next year NO BRACES.</li>
              <li>Your strength. You have been through a lot baby, and Im so sorry you have had to endure everything, but in turn itâ€™s made of the strongest, most resilient people I know, and thatâ€™s something I hope to learn from you.</li>
              <li>Your positive energy. You really a burst of energy, the moment I saw you I knew I was gonna have a fuckton of fun with you. Also ur notes in the past kinda hinted that to me.</li>
              <li>The way you communicate. As you are aware, a relationship is built on communication, and Iâ€™m so glad you can voice your problems with me, but also you do it in a way which is thoughtful and very open minded.</li>
              <li>The way you make me smile. Like itâ€™s so hard to not be around you and frown. You are the beacon in my life, and whenever iâ€™m around you itâ€™s like I have to be happy, cause I canâ€™t be any emotion.</li>
              <li>The fact you make me a better person. I canâ€™t lie when I walked into uni I was dejected, I kinda wanted to just cruise through uni. But seeing you so hard working and intelligent, made me wanna be a better person, especially academically, pushing to be my best, so I could be close to matching you.</li>
              <li>THE FACT YOU CAN NOW DRIVE. FUCK YES DRIVE ME AROUND SOMETIMES.</li>
              <li>Your creative flair. Like I did not know how creative you were honestly. Making the bracelet for me so early on, it made me feel so special and I donâ€™t know how to articulate how it made me feel. Nobody has ever done that for me, and it made me feel insanely special. Also your Spotify frame, with the cool added touch of the barcode (such a me thing) and your massive love heart card is something iâ€™m never gonna forget.</li>
              <li>Your musical and dance flair. IKnow you havenâ€™t been going crazy on it, but you a really good dancer. Iâ€™m astounded on how one person can move their body like that. And ur voice is so goddamn good. I still remember having some goosebumps hearing it (also cause ur so cute).</li>
              <li>THE FACT UR NEPALI. IKnow this sounds a bit weird, but having a girlfriend from the same country, apart from the family stuff is really nice. You understand me, my culture, expectations, and itâ€™s something we can constantly yap about, and also destroy momos.</li>
              <li>You make me feel special. IKnow if I have said this already, but you make me the centre of attention, like I am him. But seriously, you make me the most important man in the world, listened to, understood, let me be me, for that I will be forever grateful.</li>
              <li>Your entrepreneurial skills. Your tutoring business is so fucking underrated. Like you have a mini empire, you have managed to build your business from the ground up, from 60 bucks an hour, not affording the WWCC to now, raking it in with your variety of students. IDonâ€™t know anyone whoâ€™s managed to do that, and thatâ€™s seriously goddamn impressive, I am so proud of you.</li>
              <li>MY BEST FRIEND, MY EVERYTHING FRIEND. What i mean by that is, your my best friend who I can do everything with. In my life iâ€™ve always had different style of friends, including society life. Itâ€™s like all of those groups together, and thatâ€™s you. Somebody I can talk to about anything, do anything worth, say anything too, but also fucking eat with. You are like the friend iâ€™ve missed in my life, the complete package. HEHE NOT JUST FRIEND, BEST FRIEND AND BEST GIRLFRIEND. IM NOT FRIENDZONING YOU. But you are the whole package, your basically the person who decided ermmm im gonna beSameenâ€™s everything.</li>
              <li>I couldnâ€™t go without finishing list without saying ur FINEEE SHIT BODY, including your tiddies teehee i said it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just some of the reasons why I love you. IHope I can show you why you mean the world to me during your bday celebration this year. Itâ€™s a celebration on the best person I know.</p>
            <p>And good luck on a chapter in your life, a new decade to build memories and experiences, and IHope iâ€™m fortunate enough to be a few of those.</p>
            <p>HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY WIFEY MEGAN KHANAL ENJOY THAT SHIT.</p>
            <p>Love Sameen (your husband) x</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
